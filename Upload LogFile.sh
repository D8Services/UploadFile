# This script requires parameters provided from Jamf
# 4 - Api Username
# 5 - Api Password
# 6 - Path to the File (log file etc)
# The script will then check if there is in fact a file there, followed by the size of the file
# If large, the script will try to compress the file and throw a warning, otherwise it simply compresses
# it and uploads it to the Computer Record in Jamf.
